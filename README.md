## Netflix Project


-> Project Overview: 
Developed a personalized recommendation engine that suggests movies to users based on
their interests and ratings, simulating platforms like Netflix and Amazon OTT services.

-> Problem Statement: 
Focused on predicting customer behavior to enhance user engagement by recommending
movies tailored to individual preferences using historical rating and genre data.

Customer Behaviour and it’s prediction lies
at the core of every Business Model. From
Stock Exchange, e-Commerce and
Automobile to even Presidential Elections,
predictions serve a great purpose. Most of
these predictions are based on the data
available about a person’s activity either
online or in-person.

Recommendation Engines are the much
needed manifestations of the desired
Predictability of User Activity.
Recommendation Engines move one step
further and not only give information but
put forth strategies to further increase users

Services have taken up a big chunk in the
Retail and Entertainment industry.
Organizations like Netflix, Amazon etc.
