## 📌 **Project Overview**

Ever wondered how Netflix or Amazon Prime always seem to know *exactly* what you’d love to watch next? 🤔

## ❓ **Problem Statement**

Customer behavior prediction is at the heart of every modern business — from stock exchanges and e-commerce to even elections! 🗳️
**Recommendation Engines** take this a step further: they don’t just predict what users might like — they proactively help increase engagement by suggesting relevant content tailored to individual tastes.

In the age of OTT platforms and streaming services, organizations like **Netflix** and **Amazon Prime Video** rely heavily on analyzing user activity patterns to deliver personalized movie suggestions — enhancing the user experience and driving loyalty.

🎯 *This project builds such a recommendation system from the ground up!*
Each user will receive movie suggestions that align with their unique interests and past ratings.
